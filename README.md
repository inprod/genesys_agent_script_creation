# Genesys Agent Creation via script and scripted config changes

This a sample Python project to execute changes within Genesys Engage such as
the automatic creation of agents. This code can be adjusted to perform extremely
complex Genesys configuration changes by calling an InProd Changeset and optionally
passing new values to the Changeset variables.

This is an extention of the following blog article https://www.inprod.io/automating-genesys-agent-creation/

# What is InProd
